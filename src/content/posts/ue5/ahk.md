AHK(auto hotkey) let's you script your custom hotkeys. Certain hotkeys can be useful for ue5.  
Here are my keys:  
```
#SingleInstance Force

;ctrl e -> Enter
^e::Enter

;ctrl d -> Backspace
^d::BackSpace

;ctrl shift d -> Del
^+d::Del
```  
These keys are useful when you have your right hand on the mouse. These hotkeys are faster to press then taking your hand off your mouse. 0.5 second time save!

Note: this script needs to be ran in administrator mode for it to work in ue5. This is probally due to how ue5 recieves inputs.
