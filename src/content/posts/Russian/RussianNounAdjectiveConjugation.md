(I'm only 8 months into Russian, and about only 1 day into grammar, please point out any mistakes)  
Different people have different approaches to language learning, sometimes these differences might be big, so my methods might not suit you, but here they are:  
## introduction
There are six cases in Russian: Nominative Case, Genitive Case, Dative Case, Accusative Case, Instrumental Case, Prepositional Case  
Three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter  
Nouns have singular and plural forms.  
Adjectives must match the gender of Nouns  
e.g. in "Yellow car" if car is in the feminine form, yellow also needs to be in the feminine form.  
### a bit more about genders
Nouns have a gender that is default, e.g. masculine->учитель  
If you want to say "she is a teacher" it will be "она учитель". Note that учитель is in masculine form, because masculine is the default gender of учитель. You would only use the feminine form if you want to emphasize it's a female teacher.  
(not sure if what I just said is 100% correct, lmk if there is anything wrong)  
## This amazing website
### grammar tables
[This](https://www.russianforfree.com/grammar-of-russian-language.php) website has grammar tables for Nominative singular -> any other case, both nouns and adjectives
### exercises
I recommend going through a single section (too much and your brain will break), then doing [the exercises](https://www.russianforfree.com/exercises.php)  
There doesn't seem to be any nom. sing-> nom. pl exercises, you can search online for that(and other cases too). I also recommend doing exercises once in a while to help you remember.  
If you run out of exercises to do, you can go through a list of nouns/adjectives (Search for something like "top 500 Russian nouns" online). Figure out the cases/plural form of each noun/adjective yourself, and check your answer with [cooljuator](https://cooljugator.com/).
