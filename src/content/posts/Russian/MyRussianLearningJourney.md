Russian songs got me into the language.   
2024/10/14 - Stared  
2023/10/22 - Finished learning the Cyrillic alphabet  
Used Memrise to memorize vocabulary  
2023/10/22/22:47 - Reached 50 words.
2023/10/27 - Reached 100 words.  
2023/11/7 - Reached 225 words.
took a break, lasted till 2023/11/28     
2023/12/8 - Reached 400 words.    
2023/12/9 - Got Russian keyboard, changed Youtube language to Russian for immersion.
2023/12/15 - Bought some Russian books (Later turned out to be pretty useless)  
2023/12/16 - Started to learn how to roll my Rs. Finished the original course of 537 words. Started a course with 10000 words.  
around 2024/1/11 - Can successfully roll my Rs.
Started watching Russian youtube somewhere around here. Stoped writing down what I learned because novelty wore off. I am at about 1300+ words as of 2024/6/28.  
### Anki for vocabulary
2024/4/14 - Started using Anki instead because of the whole Memrise situation. The Memrise courses I did only had (Ru->En) or the opposite. Anki had both with double sided decks. Memrise had this thing called speed review, which only required you to know the vague meaning of a word to get it right. Anki needed a more precise definition.(You don't need to type, just say it in your head). After redoing/relearning each word in Anki. My Russian is now a bit better. Anki has a small learning curve but it had very good customizability, I could add a Wiktionary button that opened a Wiktionary about the word I'm currently learning.  
### Learning Russian Through Youtube
Originally, I used an Firefox extension that added dual subtitles and gave you the definition of a word upon double clicking. This was slow and sometimes the dual subtitles didn't work.  
Switched to glotDojo in chrome, worked better than my original method.
Switched to languageReactor. It had more features, such as coloring which words are unknown(It guesses your vocabulary count)
I used two separate accounts for normal youtube viewing and Russian learning, to avoid mixing recommendations.
### Grammar
2024 Started learning grammar, you can see my other blog for more information.
